\fs26 GENERAL INFO\
\pard\pardeftab560\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 \cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 Today we are going to talk about L\'92anneau des sept lumi\'e8res (The Ring of the Seven Lights) by highly influental French electroacoustic and acousmatic composer Jean-Claude Eloy, released through his own imprint Hors Territoirs.\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The single piece which this CD is originally from 1995, but has been reworked and remastered in 2013; the booklet this CD comes with puts a little light on the digital remix process in a 10 page plus booklet, consisting of interviews, photos and even screenshots of the 2013 Pro Tools sessions.\
\ls1\ilvl1

\fs26 The artwork in general is somewhat meager for today\'92s standard or bringing it into context in a highly aetheticised environment like the noise world, but given that JCE is mainly existing in the academic realm I don\'92t put much attention on that aspect. I also don\'92t put much emphasis on the concept behind this piece, since I simply don\'92t care much about meta info and really just wanna listen to the music.\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 I\'92ll just say this - the main source of sound is basically a recording of a single temple bell, manipulated through reel to reel tape manipulation and other treatment. JCE is famous for bridging spiritual sounds with electroacoustic stilings, so this is basically a workflow he\'92s proven to be very efficient at. \

\pard\pardeftab560\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 \cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 We hear a highly manipulated recording of a bell, probably altered in pitch and speed through meticulous tape work and/or editing, that\'92s being enriched with an unnatural amount of sustain.\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The sustain is slowly but steadily growing in complexity in that it starts to modulate and move in itself, either through effects or simply stretching this sustain info until artefacts start to bring this kind of movement in. However, it creates a complex and very melodic ambient soundscape giving it this kind of spiritual air.\

\fs26 The source sounds begin to change colours and complexion to a point where their roots begin to not be identifiable anymore, creating this body of reverb and shimmers that move in an imaginary room\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 There\'92s a lot of colour in this moment while it\'92s completely shapeless - \
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 At some point the shimmers and movements boil down to a single \'93bell drone\'94 that hangs quietly in the air for what feels like forever and the piece lets it simmer on low volume for a while which made me listen really closely\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 At some point the volume became so quiet that I had to crank the stereo a little only to find an otherwise hidden movement underneath the reverb component that was almost reminiscent to machinery - looped, heavily modulated swirls of sound that feel almost cold and would heavily contrast the main components of the piece if they weren\'92t so quiet\

\pard\pardeftab560\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 \cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The bell comes back in full volume, only this time the vibe changes to a way darker tone\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The sustain feedbacks way more and sounds a little more unhinged or less controlled while rhythmic, percussive jabs and hits of sound create this almost factory kind of feel\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The overall mood feels more physical now, less abstract - an image of a cathedral comes to mind with sound being amplified through structures of stone and steel and physical space; it feels large and oppressive almost \
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 Around the 22 minute mark the piece starts to amp up the intensity in frequency of sound and becomes kind of busy, which is interesting because it doesn\'92t get hard or violent in tone but the sheer size of the elements make this a very heavy part of the piece\

\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 \cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The piece slowly but steadily takes a different shape at this point, probably not on purpose but almost going into a more \'93industrial ambient\'94 direction - less \'93sound art\'94 or \'93art music\'94 with its now almost entirely uncoded sound elements that seem completely detached from their original source, painting a paint that transports more of a certain mood than pictures and concept - to me personally, it\'92s a stark, grey, brutalist vibe that feels massive and powerful, dense and cold at the same time\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The artist operates on a wide array of tracks now, filling every nook and cranny with sound and details - it feels like every direction and channel I turn my attention to there\'92s something individually performed happening\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 I\'92m not really too familiar with the concept and intended movements of this CD as it\'92s just not really sth that informs my listening pleasure much and a good piece or collection of tracks should be able to stand on their own instead of only making sense with a certain concept attached to it; but it\'92s apparent that L\'92anneau obviously acts in movements that are comprised by similar sound sources\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 So after this almost dystopian setting the piece created, the artist pulls back again to what can be identified as the Leitmotif of the piece - the reverbed residue of the original bells from the beginning of the piece\

\fs26 Around the 30 minute mark we\'92re getting into full washed out \'93dark ambient\'94 that makes me almost feel like I\'92m detached from my consciousness - floating underneath the surface of a body of water with only light and schemes of shapes getting through to me, all through heavy reverberation and filter work\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The atmosphere is so dense her that I can\'92t even let my mind wander - it lays on me like a heavy, black blanket that constraints me to this specific moment of the piece\

\pard\pardeftab560\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 \cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The piece is hitting its final third, bringing back the obvious, original bell sounds but incorporating it to the distanced, void place we\'92re at in the piece now\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 This creates a cacophony of ambience that feels uncomfortable, almost nauseating and on the verge of breaking out until it sort of does, specifically around the 38 min mark - the colours and movements come back, illuminating the dark with almost orchestral crescendos and swells that bring a certain liveliness to mix\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The last ten minutes feel like a reactivation of mind and soul, with percussive elements surpassing the reverb wall and happening right in front of the listener, oscillating in varying speed, tone and intensity - this stretch forms somewhat of a resolution in the peace as it gains a certain snappiness in tempo that less creates an atmosphere but pushes the piece and simply amps it up, gives it somewhat of a clear direction which was left on the sidelines until now\
\ls1\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 All elements that came up until now converge at this point without sounding careless and negligent as there\'92s no chaos and it\'92s still very controlled, the artist simply manages to capture the essence of the previous 40 minutes perfectly in the last stretch very gracefully \

\fs26 GENERAL FEELING\
\pard\pardeftab560\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\ls2\ilvl1
\fs24 \cf0 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 This piece feels like a rebirth through inversion and meditation to me and coming out on the other side made anew, reflected and breathing with a new mentality \
\ls2\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The piece is certainly taking its time and sometimes lacks specific direction, especially given that the movements resolve in the same Leitmotif before moving a different direction again instead following one straight narrative path - it\'92s not a negative thing, it\'92s simply a very special, non-gradual way to create an arch\
\ls2\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 It needs more attention and effort I think because the piece always expects you to create cross references within the track, creating mental notes on movements and elements\
\ls2\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 It\'92s apparent that the piece was created with a more reduced set of source sounds and relies heavily on the sound manipulation and probably post production aspect to create a more introspective, condensed experience than eg. Gaku-No-Michi with its sprawling world building and its 2hr runtime\
\ls2\ilvl1
\fs24 {\listtext	\uc0\u8259 	}
\fs26 The overall sound and mix of this CD is grand and differentiated enough to not feel overwhelming considering it\'92s so reverb laden ethereal in its core. It\'92s highly dynamic in volume while still keeping the convenience of the listener in mind, as in its never grinding to a halt when it\'92s getting really quiet until some volume readjustment has been done. Each element of the piece sits nicely without being compressed too much, giving this a very airy, light quality until the piece decides to get dense and let loose again.\
\ls2\ilvl1

\fs26 I love this piece. Thank you to Jean-Claude Eloy and Hors Territoires for keeping this CD in print and thank you dear watcher for watching :) \
